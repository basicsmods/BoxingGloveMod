This is a mod for Project Zomboid. You can see the mod on the workshop here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827693830

Refer to the workshop page for more info about this mod.

Things I'd like to add:

- In-game options to tune the drop rates. (Likely feasible)
- In-game options to tune the weapon stats. (Not sure if this is possible. If it's not possible, I could add a ton of duplicates of the weapons with slight variations and have the in-game options decide which ones get added to the loot tables.)
- Change the animation to be a punch instead of the knife stab. (Don't think this one is possible for now.)
