This is a mod for Project Zomboid. You can see the mod on the workshop here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827693830

Refer to the workshop page for more info about this mod.

Things I'd like to add:

- In-game options to tune the drop rates. (Likely feasible)
- In-game options to tune the weapon stats. (Not sure if this is possible. If it's not possible, I could add a ton of duplicates of the weapons with slight variations and have the in-game options decide which ones get added to the loot tables.)
- Change the animation to be a punch instead of the knife stab. (Don't think this one is possible for now.)
- Make it so the weapon has a random chance to change its swinganim with each swing.
- Add stars to the icons.
- Add a hotkey that toggles (or two hotkeys for choosing specifically) a jab punch (stab animation) vs swing punch (bat animation). Give the weapon different stats based on the active swingAnim (jab faster, but no knock and more push?)


(Unrelated to this mod)
- Add hotkey to cycle through containers without needing to mouse over the window.
